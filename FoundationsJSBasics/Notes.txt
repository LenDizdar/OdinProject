Lesson 1 (variables & operators):
    - Variables initialized with let or const (dynamic type). Const can't be reassigned. (var also but is deprecated)
    - No need to worry about decimals or integer division (yet), seems dynamic.

Lesson 2 (data types & conditionals)
    - STRINGS: can use either ' or ", style-wise just choose one. 
    - Can also be made with `, these are called template literals - can embed JS inside ${} and can be declared over multilines
        e.g. const name = "Len"
             const greeting = `Hello ${name}`
    - Normal strings can be concatenated with + operator. Likely template literals are preferred?
    - Template literals respect line breaks, typical strings require \n
    - Escape sequences as expected \"
    - Types are relatively dynamic, but for sanity you can use Number() on a string or String() on a number
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String <- string methods
    - COMPARISONS: same as expected, like C
    - ^ added, strict equality (===), (!==) does not perform type conversion (and will return false if non matching types)
    - CONDITIONALS: look exactly like C

Lesson 3 (devtools)
    - The DOM (Document Object Model) shows programming languages how a webpage is organized. 
    - In chrome devtools you can choose an element, add CSS classes, or simply add CSS statements to the element
    - You can also just edit the DOM HTML as you please
    - There's a button to switch to mobile view in the top left of the devtools window
    - To debug JS on a website you can view the "sources" tab to see the files, and set breakpoints on the right

Lesson 4 (functions)
    - syntax:
        function foo(param1, param2 = defaultVal) {
            return 'bar' //optional
        }
        let fubar = function(a) {
            return a*a
        }
        (param1, param2 = defaultVal) => {
            return param1 * param2
        }
        param1 => param1 + 12 //single line functions can omit return
    - Note: semicolons not really optional, but if you  don't put them in there JS will do it for you (not necessarily as intended)
    - functions are data types, you can store them in variables and copy them and such
    - Function declarations can be called before they are defined. Function expressions (function(params)) only after they are defined.
    - Call stack is C-like, callbacks go into a different place and wait for the call stack to be emptied to run. Async stuff

Lesson 6 (understanding errors)
    - Fairly straightforward, can use console log, breakpoints, debugger

Lesson 7 (clean code)
    - Use meaningful variable names
    - Be consistent with semicolons, camelCase, vocabulary (e.g. get or fetch not both)
    - No magic numbers
    - Limit line length (consistently)
    - Comments should explain "why" not "how", even still code should be self-explanatory
    - Same as was taught in CS136!

Lesson 8 (loops & arrays)
    - Syntax:
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {}
        for (const item of list) {} // this is a for-each loop
    - arr.map(fun) returns a new array with fun applied to each element
    - arr.filter(fun) returns a new array containing only elements for which fun returns true
    - arr.reduce(fun, initalValue) expects fun to take two params, fun(accumulator, current) and goes 
        through the whole array applying fun to each (accumulator, arr[i]), returning the final result
    - break and continue work as expected
    - while and do-while work as expected
    - arrays natively have pop and push, shift unshift (works on front of array, like pop from front, push to front)
    - arrays behave as objects, where each parameter is associated with a numerical key from 0 to arr.length - 1
    - ^ Don't really treat an array as an object (e.g. arr.pineapple = "ananas") because the compiler turns off array optimizations
    - arr.toString returns a comma separated list of elements
    - Never compare arrays with ==(=), as that just checks their references. Use a loop for item-by-item comparison. {No operator overloading in JS :( }
